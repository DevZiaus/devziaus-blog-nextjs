Web development is the process of creating websites and web applications that run on the Internet. **Web development** involves both designing how a website looks and functions, as well as coding how it works behind the scenes. In this article, I will talk in detail about what is web development, web development vs web design, types of web development, front-end, back-end, and full-stack web development, and their respective jobs. Stay with me to know everything about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development" target="_blank">web development</a>. 



## Web Development vs. Web Design

Web development and website design are often used interchangeably, but they are not exactly the same thing.



 Web design is a subset of web development that focuses on the visual aspects of a website, such as layout, colors, fonts, images, and user interface. Web design or website design uses tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create web pages that are appealing and easy to use.




Web development, on the other hand, encompasses web design as well as other aspects of building a website, such as programming, testing, debugging, security, and maintenance. Web development uses various programming languages and frameworks to create dynamic and interactive web applications that can handle data, logic, and functionality.




## What Are the Most Common Programming Languages?



Many programming languages can be used for web development or web application development, but some of the most popular ones are:



* **HTML**: HyperText Markup Language is the standard language for creating web pages. It defines the structure and content of a web page using tags and attributes.
* **CSS**: Cascading Style Sheets is a language that describes how HTML elements are styled and displayed on a web page. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of a web page.
* **JavaScript**: JavaScript is a scripting language that adds interactivity and functionality to web pages. It can manipulate HTML elements, respond to user events, communicate with servers, and create dynamic effects.
* **PHP**: PHP is a server-side scripting language that can execute on a web server and generate HTML output for the browser. It can handle data processing, database interaction, authentication, and other back-end tasks.
* **Python**: Python is a general-purpose programming language that can be used for web development as well as other applications. It has a simple and readable syntax and a large library of modules and frameworks that can facilitate web development.
* **Ruby**: Ruby is another general-purpose programming language that can be used for web development. It has an expressive and elegant syntax and supports multiple programming paradigms. It also has a popular web framework called Ruby on Rails that simplifies web development.




## Types of Web Development



Web development can be divided into three main types: front-end, back-end, and full-stack.



### Front-end development



Front-end development also called as web design or website design refers to the client side of web development, which deals with how a website looks and interacts with users. <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/f/frontend.htm" target="_blank">Front-end</a> developers use HTML **CSS and JavaScript** to create web pages that are attractive, responsive, accessible, and interactive.



Some of the tasks that front-end developers do are:



- Creating wireframes and mockups of how a website will look
- Writing semantic HTML code that defines the structure and content of a web page
- Applying CSS stylesheets that control the appearance and layout of a web page
- Adding JavaScript code that adds functionality and interactivity to a web page
- Testing and debugging web pages across different browsers and devices
- Optimizing web pages for performance, usability, and SEO



### Back-end development



Back-end development refers to the server side of web development, which deals with how a website works and performs. <a href="https://www.thefreedictionary.com/back+end" target="_blank">Back-end</a> developers use programming languages like PHP, Python, or Ruby to write code that runs on a web server and handles data processing, database interaction, authentication, security, and other back-end tasks.



Some of the tasks that back-end developers do are:



- Designing and implementing databases that store data for a website or web application
- Writing server-side code that responds to requests from browsers or other clients
- Integrating with external APIs or services that provide additional functionality or data
- Creating RESTful APIs that allow communication between different parts of a web application
- Testing and debugging server-side code and ensuring its reliability and scalability
- Deploying and maintaining web applications on web servers or cloud platforms



### Full-stack development



Full-stack development refers to both front-end and back-end development. Full-stack developers have the skills and knowledge to build a complete website from scratch, using both front-end and back-end technologies.



Some of the benefits of being a full-stack developer are:



- Having a holistic view of the entire web development process and understanding how different parts work together
- Being able to switch between different roles and tasks depending on the project's needs
- Being able to create prototypes and MVPs quickly and efficiently
- Being able to communicate and collaborate with other developers more effectively



## Differences Between Front-End, Back-End, and Full-Stack Development



Front-end, back-end, and full-stack development are different types of web development that have different roles, responsibilities, and skill sets. Here are some of the main differences between them:



- Front-end development focuses on the user interface of a website or web application, while back-end development focuses on the logic and functionality of a website or web application. Full-stack development involves both front-end and back-end development.
- Front-end developers use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create web pages that are visually appealing and user-friendly, while back-end developers use programming languages like PHP, Python, or Ruby to write code that runs on a web server and handles data processing, database interaction, authentication, security, and other back-end tasks. Full-stack developers use both front-end and back-end technologies to build a complete <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website" target="_blank">website</a> or web application.
- Front-end developers need to have a good sense of design, aesthetics, and usability, as well as knowledge of front-end frameworks and libraries like Bootstrap, React, or Angular. Back-end developers need to have a good understanding of data structures, algorithms, and system design, as well as knowledge of back-end frameworks and tools like Laravel, Django, or Rails. Full-stack developers need to have a broad range of skills and knowledge across both front-end and back-end domains.

##F.A.Q

#### 1. What is a website?
> A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website" target="_blank">website</a> is a collection of web pages and related content that is identified by a common domain name and published on at least one web server. Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, such as news, education, commerce, entertainment or social networking

#### 2. What does front-end mean?
> In the context of computer systems or applications, <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/f/frontend.htm" target="_blank">front-end</a> refers to the part with which the user interacts directly. It is also known as the user interface (UI) and includes the visual aspects of how a web page looks and responds to the visitor.

#### 3. What does back-end mean?
